## Abstract

EZGas is an application-based crowdsourcing service that allows users all over the world to locate gas stations in different areas, along with the types of fuels and respective prices for each gas station.
Moreover users are allowed to add further services provided at the gas station (eg. Bar, Shop, Mechanic, Car Wash, etc. )

## Stories and personas

User Mario wants to be able to individually look out for gas stations location, as well as their prices or services. He should be able to provide detail for each of his needs and matching gas station need to be highlighted in his application.

User Luigi is in a hurry and needs to find the closest possible gas station which has fuel compatible with his vehicle. The application should be able to find the best-fit for his needs in a fast way, as well as providing the needed instruction to reach the gas stations.

User Todd is on a budget and consistently needs to find the cheapest alternative available, for this reason the app should be constantly updated after each user submission. Moreover user preferences should be saved in the client application.
